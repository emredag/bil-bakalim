## 🎯 Objective

Implement **fully responsive design** that works perfectly on ANY screen size using fluid scaling, Tailwind responsive utilities (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl), CSS `clamp()` for typography, flexible grids, and viewport-aware components. Ensure safe area margins, responsive touch targets (44px min on small, 48px+ on large), and fluid typography as per PRD 8.5 and ui-ux-design.md#responsive
